## Objective: Create an AI model to predict Copper prices
---

## Introduction
The copper futures market involves the buying and selling of standardized contracts that obligate the buyer to purchase and the seller to deliver a specified quantity of copper at a predetermined price on a future date. This market allows traders and investors to speculate on the future price of copper without needing to handle the physical commodity itself. There are three of these copper futures markets in the world: Shanghai, Chicago, and London. People buy and sell these contracts based on their prediction of the future prices of these contracts. The question in this mini project is if we can build a model that can predict the price of copper contracts, specifically the one in the United States.
