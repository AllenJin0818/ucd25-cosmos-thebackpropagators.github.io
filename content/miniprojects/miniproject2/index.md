## Introduction

There are so many different genres of movies that we watch. Romance. Horror. Comedy. You name it. This project investigates similarities between features of a movie, such as genre, movie length, and popularity in order to group the large amount of movies into clusters that have similar characteristics. Using these similar characteristics, we can make conclusions about each group of movies based on how they were organized.

## Methodology and Data
In order to properly classify the dataset of movies, we used a variety of clustering techniques, including PCA and t-SNE to attempt to cluster movies into clusters.
PCA involves rotating the axis of the data in order to fit all data into two dimensions. To put it in simple words, PCA means that a line of best fit for the data becomes the new x-axis in order to make it easier to visualize and separate data. Separating data means being able to identify clusters or clumps of data that belong to a group together. 
t-SNE involves reducing the dimensions of data. Think of all the variables that are possible in movies, such as the popularity, if it is a horror film or not, and if it is a romance film or not. Each one of these characteristics represents one dimension of data, and so there would be a lot of dimensions in our movie dataset. Therefore, we would use t-SNE in order to reduce the dimensions into two dimensions which we are able to visualize and see on a plane. 

There are numerous other types of clustering techniques and different models of these techniques, but we won't dive much deeper.
