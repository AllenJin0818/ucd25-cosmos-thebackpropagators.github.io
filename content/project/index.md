## Introduction
We were given a large dataset with information about Wildfires. The dataset contained lots of characteristics and information about each fire and their locations. Such information included the year the fire occurred, the description of the cause of the fire, the state the fire occurred in, and the point location of the fire. We were given such information for more than 10,000 fires. Given this large amount of data, we had to narrow down the features and fires we used in our model to form a question.

## Question
1. Based on the locations of previous fires, can we predict future locations of fires?
2. Can we also predict the number of wildfires within a state given past information on the amount of wildfires?

## Data
Aside from the data that we were given, we also used data on average temperatures and precipitation in the wildfire areas. WE believe these factors are important as they can affect the size and effectiveness of the fire. Temperature effects how long the fire can last. Hotter temperatures dries out vegetation, creating more fuel for fires to spread quickly and intensely. Precipitation also greatly affects the intensity of wildfires. Abundant rainfall suppresses fires by moisturizing the fire's potential fuel, which makes it harder for flames to spread.

## Methodology
### 1. Processing the Data: Learn the Trends and Relationships betweeen Locations and Number of Wildfires
- found some useful information in the given dataset such as fire size, fire class, and cause of the fire
- visualized the data using a heat map that indicates the concentration and number of wildfires in the U.S.

## Discussion
"information about correct and wrong predictions with news and why"

One thing to address is that when we gathered data for the weather by longitude and latitude, we were unable to find data that completely matched the longitude and latitude that we were given. Thus, there is some degree of error (Â± 0.2) in merging the point location with the weather at that point.
