## Introduction
We were given a large dataset with information about Wildfires. The dataset contained lots of characteristics and information about each fire and their locations. Such information included the year the fire occurred, the description of the cause of the fire, the state the fire occurred in, and the point location of the fire. We were given such information for more than 10,000 fires. Given this large amount of data, we had to narrow down the features and fires we used in our model to form a question.

## Question
1. Based on the locations of previous fires, can we predict future locations of fires?
2. Can we discover any relationship between the fire size and the fire's characteristics, such as how it was caused and build a model that can accurately predict a fire's class given its characteristics?
