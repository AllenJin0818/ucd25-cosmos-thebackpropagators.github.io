## Introduction
We were given a large dataset with information about Wildfires. The dataset contained lots of characteristics and information about each fire and their locations. Such information included the year the fire occurred, the description of the cause of the fire, the state the fire occurred in, and the point location of the fire.

## Question
1. Based on the locations of previous fires, can we predict future locations of fires?
2. Can we also predict the number of wildfires within a state given past information on the amount of wildfires?

In order to learn the trends and relationships between the locations and number of wildfires in a given state, we had to first look at the data given to us. The large data set contained some useful information to us, such as the state in which the fire occurred, the class of the fire, and what caused the fire...
